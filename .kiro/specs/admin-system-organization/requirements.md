# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive administrative system organization that includes user role management, documentation centralization, and automated deployment processes. The system ensures proper administrative access control, maintains clean project structure, and provides seamless integration with Firebase and Git version control.

## Glossary

- **Admin_System**: The administrative management component of the application
- **Firebase_Service**: The Firebase backend service including Authentication and deployment
- **Git_Repository**: The version control system managing code changes
- **Documentation_Manager**: The component responsible for organizing and managing .md files
- **Deploy_Pipeline**: The automated process for deploying changes to Firebase
- **User_Role_Manager**: The component managing user permissions and administrative roles

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to designate a specific user as the system administrator, so that proper access control is established for administrative functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes, THE Admin_System SHALL verify that user with UID "gEjUSOsHF9QmS0Dvi0zB10GsxrD2" has administrator privileges
2. THE User_Role_Manager SHALL assign administrator role to the user with email "scandelari.guilherme@hotmail.com"
3. IF the designated user lacks administrator privileges, THEN THE Admin_System SHALL automatically grant administrator custom claims
4. THE Admin_System SHALL validate administrator credentials during authentication processes
5. WHILE the administrator is authenticated, THE Admin_System SHALL provide access to all administrative functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all documentation files to be centralized in a dedicated folder, so that the project structure remains clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation_Manager SHALL identify all .md files in the project root directory
2. THE Documentation_Manager SHALL create a centralized documentation directory structure
3. WHEN .md files are detected in non-documentation locations, THE Documentation_Manager SHALL move them to the central documentation folder
4. THE Documentation_Manager SHALL maintain file references and update any internal links after moving files
5. THE Documentation_Manager SHALL preserve file history during the reorganization process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all system changes to be automatically deployed to Firebase and committed to Git, so that the production environment stays synchronized with the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made, THE Deploy_Pipeline SHALL automatically commit changes to the Git_Repository
2. THE Deploy_Pipeline SHALL execute Firebase deployment after successful Git commits
3. IF deployment fails, THEN THE Deploy_Pipeline SHALL rollback changes and notify administrators
4. THE Deploy_Pipeline SHALL validate that all required environment variables are configured before deployment
5. THE Deploy_Pipeline SHALL generate deployment logs for audit and troubleshooting purposes
